QGIS-Python programming
=========================

Below is the structure of an introductory QGIS-Python course.

- `Understanding Python and QGIS <python/python.rst>`_.

- `The QGIS and PyQt APIs <apis/apis.rst>`_. You need to know how to use these APIs before you can write Python code to be run within QGIS.

- `The Python console <console/console.rst>`_. The first place to start exploring the QGIS API.

- `Expressions <expressions/expressions.rst>`_. How to create a custom Python expression and later use it in different places in QGIS. 


- `Custom Python actions <actions/actions.rst>`_. React to user interaction in the canvas or attributes table.


- `Maptips <maptips/maptips.rst>`_. Custom behaviour of map tips using QGIS expressions with Python functions.


- `Macros <macros/macros.rst>`_. Executing Python code to respond to QGIS events.


- `Processing algorithms <processing/processing.rst>`_.  In case the user needs to add analysis functionality, the best way to do it is to add a Processing algorithm.

- `Creating plugins <plugins/plugins.rst>`_. How to create QGIS plugins that can be later distributed and installed in other QGIS instances.
